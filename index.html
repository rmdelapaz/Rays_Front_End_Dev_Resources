    <h2>Internet and the World Wide Web</h2>
    <h3>What is the Internet</h3>
    <p>A common misconception is that the internet and the world wide web are the same thing. Nope. They are not. They are two completely different things that work together to provide the various tools and technology we enjoy.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>First off, the internet existed before the world wide web. The internet is a network that links different devices together. Your computer, smart phone, tablet or any other internet capable device (your refrigerator, doorbell)  connects to the internet with a unique identifier. This makes the device able to send and receive email, text messages and other communication through the internet. In the early days of the internet, before smart phones and advanced devices, all this was done through simple computer terminals. Simple terminals served as clients that would communicate through the internet to more powerful servers. Until the next digital revolution arrived to take advantage of this infrastructure</p>
    <h3>What is World Wide Web</h3>
    <p>Thanks to Tim Berners-Lee, a CERN scientist who wanted to share information with other scientists. Using an pre-existing technology called SGML, Structured Generalized Markup Language, he created HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language. Alongside the HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol) to be used with the internet. Along with a browser, a user could now connect to vast amounts of resources and as time passed, new technologies came and went. Web sites and browsers evolved or faded away. CSS came to make it pretty and JavaScript came to make programmable. Browsers and websites now handle a variety of tasks and activities that previously required dedicated hardware and complicated applications.

    <h2>HTML Information</h2>
    <h3>Useful but not important</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, it was created by a scientist to share information. Important to note because that fact answers a lot of why HTML is the way it is. Open and free and has some quirks.</p>
    <h3>HTML Breakdown</h3>
    <p>The first piece of Front End Web Development. Simply put, HTML is your content.HTML is a file format that follows structural rules in order to be rendered/displayed by a browser. You identify/markup/tag your content so the browser will know what to do with it. Tags will identify your headingss, paragrapphs, links, images and other necessary information it needs to provide to the browser. Tags are made up of a less than symbol, the tag name and ending with a greater than. For example, the create an opening paragraph tag, you would have &lt;p&gt;. In order for that to appear appropriately in a browser, the less than and greater than html codes were used instead of the keyboard less than.</p>
