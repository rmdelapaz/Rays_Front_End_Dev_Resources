    <p>Welcome to the content</p>
    <h2>Internet and the World Wide Web</h2>
    <h3>What is the Internet</h3>
    <p>A common misconception is that the internet and the world wide web are the same thing. No, they are not. They are two completely different technologies that work together enabling the various devices and applications that we have today.</p>
    <p>First off, the internet existed before the world wide web. The internet is a network that links different devices together. Your computer, smart phone, tablet or any other internet capable device (your refrigerator, doorbell)  connects to the internet with a unique identifier. This makes the device able to send and receive email, text messages and other communication through the internet. In the early days of the internet, before smart phones and advanced devices, all this was done through simple computer terminals. Simple terminals served as clients that would communicate through the internet to more powerful servers. Until the next digital revolution arrived to take advantage of this infrastructure</p>
    <h3>What is World Wide Web</h3>
    <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a CERN scientist who wanted to share information with other scientists, using an existing technology called SGML, Structured Generalized Markup Language, he created HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language. Alongside the HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol) to be used on the internet, with a web browser, a user could now connect to vast amounts of resources and as time passed, new technologies came and went. Web sites and browsers evolved or faded away. CSS came to make it pretty and JavaScript came to make programmable. Browsers and websites now handle a variety of tasks and activities that previously required dedicated hardware and complicated applications.

    <h2>HTML Information</h2>
    <h3>Useful but not important</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, it was created by a scientist to share information. Worth mentioning because that fact answers a lot of why HTML is the way it is. Open and free and has some quirks.</p>
    <h3>HTML Breakdown</h3>
    <p>The first piece of Front End Web Development. Simply put, HTML is the your content. HTML is a file format that follows structural rules in order to be rendered/displayed by a browser. You identify/markup/tag your content using HTML so the browser will know what to do with it. Tags will identify your headingss, paragrapphs, links, images and other necessary information it needs to provide to the browser. Tags are made up of a less than symbol, the tag name and ending with a greater than. For example, the create an opening paragraph tag, you would have &lt;p&gt;. In order for that to appear appropriately in a browser, the less than and greater than html codes were used instead of the keyboard less than.</p>
    <h2>CSS Information</h2>
    <h3>Why CSS?</h3>
    <p>Short answer, HTML is not pretty. It was not meant to be. Remember, a scientist who wasn't concerned about how it looked but more focused on the content. Early web developers concerned with aesthetics tried all sorts of clever hacks and tricks. Using tables and slicing up images for layout was what it took before CSS. Cascading Style Sheets</p>
    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is another technology we use to dictate/apply rules to HTML. With CSS, you can specify what colors to use, what typeface, size, positing and many other properties that deal with aesthetics.</p>
    <h3>Why is it called CSS?</h3>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets refer to cascading water falls. Water flows down to the lowest level and so does CSS. At the top-most level, style sheets, separate files that web pages could link to. Followed by on a lower tier, embedded styles, style rules contained in the head area of the particular web page to affect. And the final level, inline style, at the lowest level where the style rule is in the opening of the html tag. The rules flow downward, cascade from the top down to the bottom, combining the rules if there are no conflicts and applying the last rule if rules do conflict.</p>
    <p>Since different browsers and devices have different defaults, a good practice is to reset the css to the same initial values in the beginning. To help with this, visit <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" target="_blank">Meyer Web</a></p>
    <p>We stand on the shoulders of giants. Thank you!</p>
    <p>Words to learn in this language are the different selectors (as the name implies, selects the html element/elements you want to modify, many many properties (the aesthetic you want to affect, color, size, position) and the possible values to apply to that particular property. For example, the CSS Rule below assigns the blue value to the color property of the hi element (since that was used as the selector)</p>
    <code>
      h1 { color: blue;}
    </code>
    <p>Just like any language, CSS is fussy about syntax and structure. How to set the appropriate selectors can be a challenge in itself in conjunction with HTML to identify and classify sections and divs within the HTML page. The rule syntax is as follows, within the set of curly braces associated with the selector, the name of the property followed by a colon. The colon is then followed by an appropriate value or even multiple (appropriate) values for the property.</p>
