    <h2>What is Cascading Style Sheets?</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets better known as CSS is the language/technology used
      to add aesthetic rules to documents. In web development, this is usually
      HTML. There are other documents others use CSS with, documents such as XML
      and SVG. We are not going into that here. The focus is on CSS as it
      relates to modern Front End Web Development. When I say modern, I mean the
      last decade of web development and when I refer to "classic" web
      development, I'm referring to the decade or even the first years of web
      existence.
