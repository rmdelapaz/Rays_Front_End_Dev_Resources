    <h1>Cascading Style Sheets Information</h1>
    <h2>What is Cascading Style Sheets?</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets better known as CSS is the language/technology used
      to add aesthetic rules to documents. In web development, this is usually
      HTML. There are other documents others use CSS with, documents such as XML
      and SVG. We are not going into that here. The focus is on CSS as it
      relates to modern Front End Web Development. When I say modern, I mean the
      last decade of web development and when I refer to "classic" web
      development, I'm referring to the decade or even the first years of web
      existence. CSS was created because Tim Berners-Les, the scientist who created HTML was not concerned about type-faces, colors and positioning as much as to what the information was. CSS came around to provide a way to control the aesthetics, the look, the style.

    <h2>Why use Cascading Style Sheets?</h2>
    <p>In the early days of web development, without CSS, clever web developers and designers hacked ways to have control over the layout of their web page. Using tables, sliced images and all manner of coercion and trickery, wonderful looking websites were created. Albeit, with a lot of effort. Then smart phones, tablets and other devices to view your website with various screen sizes that we need to deal with. Thanks to CSS, web developers can create layouts that are flexible and adjust automagically with appropriate properties and values applied.</p>
