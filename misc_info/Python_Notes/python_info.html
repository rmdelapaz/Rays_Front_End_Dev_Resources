    <h1>Python</h1>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      A popular programming language that can be used for a variety of
      applications
    </p>
    <h2>Why learn and use it?</h2>
    <p>
      It's a language that is used for web development, Artificial intelligence, data mining and other powerful applications.
    </p>
    <p>If it's your first programming language, it is one of the easier C like programming language out there. What do I mean by C like? C is one of the first popular programming language made. As such, other programming languages created after made use of that popularity and built similar, C like languages, C++, Java, PHP, Javascript and here we are with Python. Similarities with some of the syntax rules will be all over the place</p>
    <p>If have experienced Javascript or some other C like programming language, you will see a lot of similarities in the syntax. The use of curly braces and semi colons.</p>
    <p>Most programming languages have loops and if statements.</p>
    <h2>Dowloading and installing Python</h2>
    <p>If you did start your programming adventure with javascript, you didn't have to download and install anything if you already had a modern web browser. Modern web browsers have the capability of processing and understanding javascript built in as part of its standard. You don't need anything special to create javascript, a text editor works. For Python, it's a different story. You need to download and install python and an application that makes creating python code easier.</p>
    <p>The address for Python downloads is: https://www.python.org/downloads/</p>
    <p>  Scroll down to the appropriate link for the operating system you are using. (windows, macOS, Linux/Unix or other)</p> 
    <p> Click on appropriate link to download Python installer. (as of last check, latest version is 3.12.5)</p>
     <p>Once it's downloaded, double click on the downloaded installer to run. Have it create appropriate paths.
