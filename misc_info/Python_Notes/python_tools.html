    <h1>Downloading Python</h1>
    <h2>Language Interpreter and IDE</h2>
    <p>
      Python is not native or built in. You need to download and install the Python interpreter. A necessary application to be able to process your python code. This download also comes with an IDE called IDLE.
    </p>
   
    <h2>Dowloading and installing Python</h2>
    <p>If you did start your programming adventure with javascript, you didn't have to download and install anything if you already had a modern web browser. Modern web browsers have the capability of processing and understanding javascript built in as part of its standard. You don't need anything special to create javascript, a text editor works. For Python, it's a different story. You need to download and install python and an application that makes creating python code easier.</p>
    <p>The address for Python downloads is: https://www.python.org/downloads/</p>
    <p>Scroll down to the appropriate link for the operating system you are using. (windows, macOS, Linux/Unix or other)</p> 
    <p>Click on appropriate link to download Python installer. (as of last check, latest version is 3.12.5)</p>
     <p>Once it's downloaded, double click on the downloaded installer to run. Have it create appropriate paths.</p>
      <p>Once this is done, you will have not only the python programming language installed but you should also have an integrated developer environment (IDE) that python calls IDLE in honor of Monty Python member Eric Idle</p>
      <p>That is a fine option to begin with. Another IDE that a lot of developers use is Visual Studio Code. It's a free download from microsoft. Test your google powers and see if you can find it.</p>
      <p>Whether you choose to write or develop your python code in IDLE or VS Code is ultimately up to you when it's your own project and when working for a client, you may be told to use what ever your client prefers.</p>
