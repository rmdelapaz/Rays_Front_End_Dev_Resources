    <h1>Command Line Interface</h1>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Being able to navigate and manipulate files and folders/directories is a
      skill you probably have mastered using the GUI and mouse. The command line
      interface (CLI for short) is also known as terminal (mac/linux), gitbash
      or powershell (windows). Regardless of what you call it or how you
      activate it, what is does is provide a non-mouse way of navigating and
      manipulating files and folders/directories.
    </p>
    <h2>Why learn and use it?</h2>
    <p>
      It's a necessary skill. Reality is that the command line interface maybe all you have available to you to work with. Another reason is to make scripts and batch files that
      navigate/manipulate folders and files
