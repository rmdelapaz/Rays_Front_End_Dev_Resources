    <h3>Keyboard differences</h3>
    <p>
      Being able to navigate and manipulate files and folders/directories is a
      skill you probably have mastered using the GUI and mouse. The command line
      interface (CLI for short) is also known as terminal (mac/linux), gitbash
      or powershell (windows).
    </p>
    <h3>Universal Keys that you may or may not have</h3>
    <p>End key and Home key. F12. FN.</p>
    <h3>Universal keys that you should have available</h3>
