    <h1>HyperText Markup Language: Basic Text Structure</h1>
    <h2>Paragraphs and line breaks</h2>
    <p>
      Probably one of the most basic and most used tag is the p tag. Thats what
      we use for the majority of HTML text content.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML has markup identifying where the content should have a line break,
      this is the br tag. Worth noting that the br tag similar to the img tag
      does not jhave a closing tag. It is closed by a slash right before the
      greater than sign of the br tag. There will be a line break<br />
      See sample below<br />
      This line of text is forced on the next line by a br tag.
    </p>
    <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>
    <h2>Non Breaking spaces</h2>
    <p>
      Such was the concern for the sanctity and inviolate nature of some text, a
      markup to ensure that the space between two elements/content be always
      side by side. A good example of this is the name "de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Paz". By
      having the appropriate markup between de and la and between la and Paz, it
      will treat that last name as one unit instead of three separate potential
      lines. See code sample below.
    </p>
    <code>de&amp;nbsp;la&amp;nbsp;Paz</code>
  </body>
