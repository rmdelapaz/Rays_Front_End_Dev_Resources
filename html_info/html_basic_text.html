    <h1>HyperText Markup Language Basic Text</h1>
    <h2>Paragraphs and line breaks</h2>
    <p>
      Probably the most basic and most used tag is the p tag. Thats what we have
      for the majority of our text content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other HTML tags exist to provide markup identifying where the browser
      should have a line break, this is the br tag. Worth noting that the br tag
      similar to the img tag is closed by a slash right before the greater than
      sign of the br tag.<br />
      See sample below
    </p>
    <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>
    <p>
      The br tag is useful for addresses where you want several lines of text
      treated as one paragraph instead of separate elements.
