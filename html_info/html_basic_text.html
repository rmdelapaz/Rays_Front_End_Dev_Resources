    <h1>HyperText Markup Language Basic Text</h1>
    <h2>Paragraphs and line breaks</h2>
    <p>
      Probably the most basic and most used tag is the p tag. Thats what we have
      for the majority of HTML text content.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML even has markup identifying where the browser should have a line
      break, this is the br tag. Worth noting that the br tag similar to the img
      tag is closed by a slash right before the greater than sign of the br
      tag.<br />
      See sample below
    </p>
    <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>
    <p>
      Such was the concern for the sanctity and inviolate nature of some text, a
      markup to ensure that the space between two elements/content be always
      side by side. A good example of this is the name "de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Paz". By
      having the appropriate markup between de and la and between la and Paz, it
      will treat that last name as one unit instead of three separate potential
      lines. See code sample below.
    </p>
    <code>de&amp;nbsp;la&amp;nbsp;Paz</code>
