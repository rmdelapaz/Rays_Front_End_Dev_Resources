    <p>
      Headings provide a way to organize HTML documents into a logical hiearchy.
      In HTML, there are six levels of headings beginning with h1, the largest
      to h6, the smallest. You should only use heading one once per page and use
      other subordinates headings as necessary and appropriately.

      Optimazation (SEO) and for accessibility. Proper use of headings greatly
      help assistive reading devices for visually impaired users and anytime
