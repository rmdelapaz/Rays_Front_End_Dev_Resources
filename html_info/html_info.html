    <h2>What is Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>
    <p>
      The first version of Hyper Text Markup Language, created by Tim
      Berners-Lee in 1993 using Structured Generalized Markup Language. As a
      scientist whose intent was to share information, attention was given more
      to information itself rather than the aesthetics. HTML is what web
      developers use to define and identify the web content through the use of
      HTML "tags". These tags are contained in less than (&lt:) and greater than
      (&gt;) symbols. These tags often come in pairs with a beginning tag
      marking the start of the content identified and at the end, a
      corresponding closing tag the would have a slash (/) right after the less
      than symbol of the closing tag.
