    <h1>HyperText Markup Language - div and section tags</h1>
    <h2>What is div and section</h2>
    <p>
      Certain tags such as header and footer are simple and straight forward as
      to what they are and what the items are that are marking up while some
      such as div and section might be less obvious to their usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some mistakenly claim/think that HTML is a programming language. Um, it's
      in the name. It is a markup language that has no logic or algorithm. All
      it has is markup for the data structure.
