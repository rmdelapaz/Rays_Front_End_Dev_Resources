    <h1>HyperText Markup Language - div, span and section tags</h1>
    <h2>What is div, span and section</h2>
    <p>
      Certain tags such as header and footer are simple and straight forward as
      to what they are and what the items are that are marking up while some
      such as div and section might be less obvious to their usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something to keep in mind with HTML is that it's purpose it to "markup",
      "identify" or "tag" elements, or portions of a document. Semantically
      tagging content for differently abled people and/or SEO is just good
      practice and beneficial to all users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large sections of text or contant that need identifying or classification
      would use the section tag while a smaller division of text would use div
      and a small span of text would use the span tag
