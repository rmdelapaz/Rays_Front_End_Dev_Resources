    <h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>
    <h2>What are they</h2>
    <p>
      Data containers with an identifier (a name) and usually at least a single value if not more.In modern javascript, you can even have a variable contain a function.
    </p>
    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>
      Modern javascript way is using let or const to declare a variable (for const, you will also need to assign a value at moment of declaration). Classic javascript only had var as a way to declare variables and no longer recommended for use.
