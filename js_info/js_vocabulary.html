    <h1>JavaScript and Arrays</h1>
    <h2>What is a Javascript Array?</h2>
    <p>
      A data structure with indexed values separtated by commas. Being indexed
      makes that data ordered. Arrays are often used to store and access arrays
      of arrays of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's worth pointing out that Javascript and most programming languages
      start with index zero and not one. If you have five items in your array,
      they would be indexed 0 trhough 4.
