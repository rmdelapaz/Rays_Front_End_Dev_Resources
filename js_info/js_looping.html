    <h1>JavaScript and Looping</h1>
    <h2>What is looping?</h2>
    <p>
      Need it done again and again? Looping is a programming structure that allows you to repeat a set of code in a various ways
    </p>
    <h3>For Loops</h3>
    <p>
      To iterate/go over through code a set number of times, the for loop is what should be used.
    </p>
    <h3>While Loops</h3>
    <p>
      To execute a set of code repeatedly until condition is met to then exit the loop.
    </p>
    <h3>Filter</h3>
    <p>Filter loops are used with arrays to filter/keep items in a new array based on a boolean test, if the array item passes the boolean (is true), it is filtered in the array, false items are filtered out</p>
    <h3>Map</h3>
    <p>Map iterates/goes over each item in an array and processes each with some code.</p>
