    <h1>JavaScript Tools</h1>
    <h2>What you need to view Javascript</h2>
    <p>
      First off, you must have a modern browser capable of parsing/understanding Javascript code. Typically Google's Chrome browser is used by the majority of web developers. Even before making separate files, using Chrome's console to view and test code results is a vital skill.
    </p>
    <h2>What you need to create and edit Javascript</h2>
    <p>
      To create and edit files with javascript code, any simple text editor will do but not recommended. Many sophisticated and free applications dedicated to developing code exist and often used by professionals. A free industrial strength application commonly used by developers is VS Code but by no means is it the only one you should investigate.
