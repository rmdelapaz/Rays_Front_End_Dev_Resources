    <h1>JavaScript and Function</h1>
    <h2>What is a Javascript Function?</h2>
    <p>
      A set of code with a name that provides utility and reusability. Rather than repeating the same set of code statements, putting it in a function provides reusability.
    </p>
    <p>Functions also have a way to receive data and act on that data and provide a result to the function.</p>
    <h2>Parameters and Arguments</h2>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>When creating a function, you as the developer can create parameters. Parameters are placeholders for incoming provided information.</p>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <p>When using a function, you as the function user provide the necessary values for the function to perform properly. The actual data or values to be used are referred to as arguments.</p>
