    <title>Ray's Front End Web Dev Resources: JS - Functions</title>

    <h1>JavaScript and Function</h1>
    <h2>What is a Javascript Function?</h2>
    <p>
      A set of code with a name that provides utility and reusability. Rather than repeating the same set of code statements, putting it in a function provides reusability.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Functions with out any parameters</h2>
    <p>Many functions exist that do something without needing any extra information. Increase or decrease a count or tally of some sort would most likely not need any information for it to do what it needs to.</p>
<h2>Using a function</h2>
<p>To use or call or invoke (all are synonymous and interchangeable when refering to have a function do what its suppose to) a declared function, one way is to use it's name followed by open and close parenthesis.</p>
    <p>There are functions that need information to do what is required of them. These functions will receive data and act on that data and provide a result to the function.</p>
    <h2>Parameters and Arguments</h2>
    <p>Two terms new developers often struggle with. Important to know the distinction though, it might come up in an interview. Otherwise, something to impress your friends with.</p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>When creating/planning a function, you as the developer can create parameters. Parameters are placeholders for incoming provided information. What information does the function need? What are you going to call them? The identifiers you create are the parameters.</p>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <p>When using/invoking a function, the function user provide the necessary values for the function to perform properly. The actual data or values to be used are referred to as arguments.</p>
