    <h2>What are Javascript Comments?</h2>
    <p>
      Comments are text that is not treated a processed code. It's meant to serve as information
    </p>
    <p>
      It's worth pointing out that Javascript and most programming languages
      start with index zero and not one. If you have five items in your array,
      they would be indexed 0 trhough 4.
