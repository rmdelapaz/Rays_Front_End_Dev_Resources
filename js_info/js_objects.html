    <p>
      A data structure with key:value pairs separated by commas. Order of data is not guaranteed when iterated through. Similar but not exactly the same as other objects in other programming languages that have objects.

    <p>Objects can hold various types of data, even other objects. Object contain more than just information, objects can also contain functionality. Within objects, you can create functions that are part of that object. If a function is part of an object, that function is referred to as a method of that object</p>
