    <h1>JavaScript Information</h1>
    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
    <p>
      Javascript is currently the most popular progrmaming language on in use
      today. Do not confuse it with Java, another industry standard programming
      language. Javascript was named Javascript for marketing purposes and to
      cause consfusion. Some even refer to Javascript as ECMAScript. Most refer
      to it as JS. JS originally only functioned on the client, the browser.
      Major advances has made it possible to have JS on the server side. But
      WHAT is it? JS provides dynamic processing. Without JS, you can have HTML
      for content and CSS for aesthetics, the web page will be static,
      unreactive other than through links anc CSS animations. With JS, reactive
      web pages can respond to user actions and dynamically update the webpage.
      Despite the diminiutive script in the name, do not let that fool you.
      Javascript is a full blown programming language and not a lightweight
      scripting or macro writing system.
    </p>
    <h2>When and Why Javascript</h2>
    <p>
      To have reactive/responsive content beyond what CSS provides, Javascript
      and the DOM provides that capability. Javascript will be used on the front
      end to update pieces of the webpage rather than refreshing the entire page
      like early traditional web pages. Javascript can be used on the backend to
      retrieve and manipulate data on the servers.
