    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
    <p>
      Javascript is currently the most popular progrmaming language on this
      planet. Do not confuse it with Java, another industry standard programming
      language. Javascript was named Javascript for marketing purposes and to
      cause consfusion. Some even refer to Javascript as ECMAScript. Most refer
      to it as JS. JS originally only functioned on the client, the browser.
      Major advances has made it possible to have JS on the server side. But
      WHAT is it? JS provides dynamic processing. Without JS, you can have HTML
      for content and CSS for aesthetics, the web page will be static,
      unreactive other than through links anc CSS animations. With JS, reactive
      web pages can respond to user actions and dynamically update the webpage.
