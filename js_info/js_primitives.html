    <h1>JavaScript Primitives</h1>
    <h2>What are Javascript primitives</h2>
    <p>
      Primitive is the designation used for different types of indivisible units of data. It could be someone's first name, age or if it's raining outside (true or false). An individual character in itself is a primitive.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Primitives</h2>
    <h3>strings</h3>
    <p>
      For non programmers, strings can be for guitars, kites and quantum theory.
      I've had a student mention string cheese. In javascript and most
      programming languages (check to be sure), any characters or text within
      in single or double quotes will be considered a string. Why it's called string has many stories. Maybe because it is a sequence of letters orignially referred to as a "string of    characters".
    </p>
    <h3>numbers</h3>
    <p>
      The amount or how much of something (quantity/price) is usually expressed
      in numerical fashion. Numbers are primitives we could used math on. Using math on strings is silly. (unless that's what you need to do)
    </p>
    <h3>boolean</h3>
    <p>
      Named after an english mathematician, Professor George Boole who came up with algebraic notiation used to represent logical propositions. A boolean is
      either true or false. A boolean expression is something that determines or results in a boolean (true or false). We learn more about this with conditionals aka if statements.
    </p>
    <h3>undefined</h3>
    <p>As the word says, when an identifier is referred to and it hasn't been defined or doesn't exist, undefined is the resulting type</p>
    <h3>null</h3>
    <p>When something is null, it is empty, devoid of content.</p>
