    <h1>JavaScript Primitives</h1>
    <h2>What are Javascript primitves</h2>
    <p>
      Primitives are the smallest, individual unit of data. It could be
      someone's first name, age or if it's raining outside (true or false).
    </p>
    <h2>Types of primitives</h2>
    <h3>Strings</h3>
    <p>
      For non programmers, strings can be for guitars, kites and quantum theory.
      I've had a student mention string cheese. In javascript and most
      programming languages (check to be sure), any characters or text contained
      in single or double quotes will be considered a string. Called string
      because it is a sequence of letters orignially referred to as a "string of
      characters"j.
    </p>
    <h3>Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      The amount or how much of something (quantity/price) is usually expressed
      in numerical fashion. Numbers are primitives we could used math on. Using
      math on strings is silly.
    </p>
    <h3>Boolean</h3>
    <p>Named after an english mathematician, George Boole who came up with algebraic notiation used to represent logical propositions.</p>
