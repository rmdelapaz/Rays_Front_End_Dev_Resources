    <h1>JavaScript and Arrays</h1>
    <h2>What is a Javascript Array?</h2>
    <p>
      A data structure with indexed values separated by commas. Being indexed
      makes that data ordered. Arrays are often used to store and access arrays
      of arrays of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important to note that Javascript and most programming languages
      start with index number zero and not number one. If you have five items in your array,
      they would be indexed 0 trhough 4.
